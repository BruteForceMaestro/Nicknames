# Nicknames
 Allows all players to set their nickname via a console command. (`.nick "balls"`)

That nickname will be saved in files, so they don't have to set it all again. Truly a work of art. Technological feat. Giant leap for humanity.
## Config
```
nicknames:
  is_enabled: true
  character_limit: 100
```
very customisable indeed.
